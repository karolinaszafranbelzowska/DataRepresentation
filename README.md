### Karolina Szafran-Belzowska, G00376368

This project has been carried out as an assignment of the Data Representation module of the Higher Diploma In Data Analytics at GMIT.

### Contents
My project consists of the following elements:

- (not yet) mySQL database
- Python 'DAO' programme to access the mySQL database
- (not yet) Python 'application' to run a Flask server
- (not yet)Several html pages and associated JavaScript and css files as a user interface

### DAO
DAO stands for Data Access Object. The EmployeeDAO.py file consists of a number of functions which access the database and perform CRUD operations. 
It is a pattern that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. The DAO provides some specific data operations without exposing details of the database[1].
